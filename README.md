# Development phase

```
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
bower install
```

# Testing

To test in the browser, use a recent version of Firefox (Aurora)
and install the [Force Cors](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/forcecors/)
plugin (enable it in the bottom right corner).

It's also useful to enable the *responsive design view* in the *Web Developer*
menu.

You can refresh the app by doing a double click anywhere in the screen.
